## Installation & usage

### ArchLinux (AUR)
This fortune-mod is available in the AUR, just look for the
[`fortune-mod-metalfairytale-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fortune-mod-metalfairytale-git/)
and
[`fortune-mod-metalfairytale-fr-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fortune-mod-metalfairytale-fr-git/)
packages!


### Manual installation

Provided you already have a fortune-cookie program installed, just copy the
`metal-fairy-tale` and `metal-fairy-tale.dat` files to `/usr/share/fortune`!

Thou shall then invoke the following command to bring some faerie to your terminal...

```bash
$ fortune metal-fairy-tale
```

### Frog variant
Same as above... just use `metal-fairy-tale-fr` and `metal-fairy-tale-fr.dat` instead!
Invoke with:

```bash
$ fortune metal-fairy-tale-fr
```

### Optional
If for any reason you want to regenerate the random access file (metal-fairy-tale.dat),
say to have strings in a different order, just run `strfile` with the desired options:

```bash
$ strfile [MY_OWN_EVIL_OPTIONS] metal-fairy-tale
```
